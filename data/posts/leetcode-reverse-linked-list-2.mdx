## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1.

  alt="example1"
/>

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

### Example 2.

```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`

## Thoughtsï¼š

This problem shares similarities with Leetcode's "206. Reverse Linked List," However, this problem comes with an additional condition: we are tasked with reversing nodes only within a specified range.

To solve this challenge efficiently, we can divide it into two main tasks:

- Locate the starting node within the range.
- Reverse the linked list within the specified range.

By accomplishing these steps with precision, we can effectively solve the problem, all while adhering to a concise and structured approach.

### Codes

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or left == right:
            return head

        # Create a dummy node to handle the edge case of start reversing from the first node
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        prev = dummy

        # move the pointer to the starting point
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            prev = prev.next

        # Initialize 'current' to the first node to reverse
        # (will link to the remaining part)
        current = prev.next

        # reverse the list between left and right
        for _ in range(right - left):
            # Store the next node to avoid losing the reference
            next_node = current.next

            # Reverse the direction of the current node
            current.next = next_node.next

            # Link the next_node to the remaining reversed part
            next_node.next = prev.next

            # Update 'prev' to include the reversed node
            prev.next = next_node

        return dummy.next
```

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n);  
  Only traverse the linked list for once
- Space Complexity: O(1);  
  Only use 3 variables
