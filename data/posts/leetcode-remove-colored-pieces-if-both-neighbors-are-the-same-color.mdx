## Description

There are `n` pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by `A` or by `B`. You are given a string `colors` of length `n` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` piece.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves **first**.

- Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored `A` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `A`. She is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `B`.
- Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored `B` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `B`. He is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `A`.
- Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
- If a player **cannot** make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` if Alice wins, or return `false` if Bob wins.

### Example 1.

```
Input: colors = "AAABABB"
Output: true

Explanation:
AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
Thus, Alice wins, so return true.
```

### Example 2.

```
Input: colors = "AA"
Output: false

Explanation:
Alice has her turn first.
There are only two 'A's and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.

```

### Example 3.

```
Input: colors = "ABBBBBBBAAA"
Output: false

Explanation:
ABBBBBBBAAA -> ABBBBBBBAA
Alice moves first.
Her only option is to remove the second to last 'A' from the right.

ABBBBBBBAA -> ABBBBBBAA
Next is Bob's turn.
He has many options for which 'B' piece to remove. He can pick any.

On Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= colors.length <= 105`
- `colors consists of only the letters 'A' and 'B'`

## Approach - Brute forceï¼š

To crack this problem, consider the colors string:

1. A color can only go if it's flanked by identical colors.
2. After removal, the string shifts, so rechecking is key for further removals.
3. Keep going until one color can't be removed anymore

### Codes

```python
class Solution:
    # Remove color from colors and return the new colors,
    # if cannot remove, return empty string
    def remove_color(is_alice, colors):
        # Remove "A" in Alice's turns and "B" in Bob's turns
        color = "A" if is_alice else "B"

        # Iterate through the colors string and find if there are any char has same color with its neighbor
        for i in range(len(colors) - 2):
            if colors[i] == color and colors[i + 1] == color and colors[i + 2] == color:
                # remove the removable char and return the new string
                return colors[:i+1] + colors[i+2:]

        # if the function doesn't return after the loop,
        # mean no char is removable, so return empty sting,
        # which mean the player loses the game
        return ""

    # Alice starts first
    is_alice = True
    # Keep looping until there is a result
    while True:
        colors = check_can_remove(is_alice, colors)

        # return the opposite player if get a empty string
        if not colors:
            return not is_alice

        # if removed a char, it's next person's turn
        is_alice = not is_alice
```

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$;  
   The search method complexity is O(n) in the worst case, and we will need to loop over the entire colors string so we do O(n) search for n time. The complexity will be $O(n^2)$

- Space Complexity: $O(1)$;

### Approach - Count "AAA" and "BBB"

Given that we can only remove a color when it's flanked by two identical colors, it becomes evident that we won't ever eliminate the boundary separating different colors.

By recognizing this, we can simplify our approach: we count how many of each color can be removed and then compare these counts to determine the outcome.

```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        # init the counts to 0
        a, b = 0, 0

        for i in range(len(colors) - 2):
            # if there's a removable color, add the count
            if colors[i] == colors[i+1] == colors[i+2]:
                if colors[i] == "A":
                    a += 1
                else:
                    b += 1

        # the bigger numbe means they have more element
        return a > b
```

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$;  
   We only iterate the colors string for once to count the number of removable char
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$;
