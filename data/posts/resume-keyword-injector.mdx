After applying for over 300 internship positions in 9 months with only handful passing resume screening, I started questioning everything.
Was my resume really that terrible? I'm an honest job seeker -- I only applied to positions where I had at least 70% of the required skills.
Yet the rejection rate was brutal.

That's when I started suspecting the real culprit: ATS filtering. Maybe it wasn't about my qualifications at all.
Maybe it was because I wrote `React.js` instead of `ReactJS`, or `Database` instead of `DB`.
Small differences in the keywords that had nothing to do with my actual abilities,
but everything to do with getting filtered out before a human ever saw my resume.

## The Problem Deep Dive

So I decided to dig deeper. If my suspicion was right maybe the problem wasn't my qualifications
--it was how ATS systems were interpreting my resume.

### Learning How ATS Really Works

I started researching how these systems actually function, and what I discovered was both enlightening and concerning.
98.4% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS to manage their hiring process.
These systems don't read resumes the way humans do.
Instead, they convert your carefully formatted PDF into plain text and run it through keyword matching algorithms.

The process seemed straightforward enough: the system takes the job description, identifies key terms, then searches your resume for matches.
Your resume gets assigned a relevance score based on how many keywords it contains and how closely they match the original job posting.
Simple string matching, not intelligent understanding.

### The Keyword Variation Problem

This is where I started to see potential issues. Through online ATS testing tools and developer forums,
I learned that these systems can be quite literal in their matching:

- A job posting asking for `React.js` might not recognize `ReactJS` or `React` as the same thing.
- `JavaScript` vs `JS` could be treated as different technologies.
- `PostgreSQL` vs `Postgres` - potentially different databases to an algorithm

Look at my own resume, I had listed `TypeScript, JavaScript` and `React, Next.js` - but what if a job description used `TypeScript/JavaScript` or `React.js`?
Would the ATS recognize these as matches?

I tested this theory using some free ATS scanning tools online with different keyword variations.
The result is that seemingly minor differences in terminology could impact match scores.

### Why This Affects Everyone

The scope of this problem was bigger than I expected.
88% of employers believe they are losing out on highly qualified candidates who are screened out by ATS systems.

#### For job seekers:

We might have exactly the right experience but get filtered out because we used different terminology than what the algorithm expected.

#### For employers:

They exclude viable candidates whose resumes do not match the criteria but who could perform at a high level.

#### For the industry:

We're optimizing for keyword matching rather than actual capability assessment.

### My Hypothesis

Based on this research, I developed a theory:
many qualified job seekers weren't getting rejected because they were unqualified
--they were getting rejected because of keyword mismatches that no human would consider meaningful.

The solution seemed clear: if ATS systems were looking for specific keyword matches, maybe there was a way to help bridge the gap.
Not by misrepresenting skills, but by ensuring genuine qualifications were presented in the terminology these systems expected to find.

That's when I started thinking about building a tool to address this keyword matching problem.

## My Solution

If the system is broken, can I work around it?
This is my first thought after understanding how ATS systems worked.
As a developer, my instinct was to build something.

The idea was simple:
put invisible keywords in my resume so that ATS systems could see them, but human recruiters would see the same clean, professional document.
This would help me pass the initial screening and get my resume in front of actual people.

I thought carefully about this approach. I wasn't trying to create a tool to deceive anyone,
but rather to ensure my real qualifications were visible to both machines and humans.
If I wasn't actually qualified for a job, this tool wouldn't help me get hired—
it would just get me to the interview stage where my actual skills would be evaluated.

### The Technical Journey

I will always think about the input and output of a product.
For input, I initially set it as a markdown file because my own resume is written in markdown.
However, after some research, I found that not a lot of people write their resume in markdown format,
so I decide to set the input as a PDF file, since most people export their resume to a PDF format when they upload to an application.
And for output, it will have to be a PDF file because users will be able to directly upload it to the application website.

### How to Hide Text

I discovered several ways to make text invisible. The most straightforward way is to put white text on a white background.
I also found I could make text so small so it became invisible to the naked eye,
or place keywords in document margins where they wouldn't interfere with the layout.

Rather than betting on a single method,
I decided to implement five different techniques.
This would give users flexibility and increase the chances of success across different ATS systems.

### Building the Tool

The development process involved solving several technical challenges.
Originally I extracted all the text from the input PDF and then write it into a new file after adding the keywords.
This approach has a big problem, it doesn't preserve the style and the format of the original PDF. Although the output text is correct,
it looks completely different to what we want it to be. So I decided to add a overlay to the input file instead.
After adopting the new approach, I successfully added the keywords to the resume while preserving the style and format.

Another important decision was the user interface approach: interactive prompts versus direct command execution.
I like the feeling of `npx next init` which will prompt me all the options I need for the project,
and also like the `curl` one line command that includes all the arguments in the command and get everything done in a single line.
So I made both exist, when users type only `resume-keyword-injector` or with some arguments, it will enter interactive mode and prompt users to enter necessary information.
But if users give me all the arguments, we will directly run the command without extra prompting.

With this hybrid approach, users will have a lot more flexibility to choose which way they like.

As I built out the functionality, I added comprehensive error handling so the tool would fail gracefully rather than corrupting someone's resume.
I added progress indicators and clear feedback messages so users would understand what was happening. I wrote detailed documentation with examples.

The final version could process any PDF resume, add keywords using five different invisible methods,
and handle everything from single resumes to batch processing.
It included safeguards to prevent common mistakes and provided helpful error messages when things went wrong.

After the development and testing, I had a working solution to keyword matching problem.
The technical challenge was solved, but I was beginning to understand that building the tool was just the first step in a much larger conversation.

## The Ethical Considerations and Reality Check

After I completed the tool, I did more research about this topic before publishing the tool.
What I discovered gave me pause.

It turns out that keyword injection is an old trick, and most recruiters are aware of it.
The problem is that it's often misused by people who use these technique to stuff skills they don't actually have into resumes, then show up to the interview completely unprepared.
This has created a negative perception of any resume optimization techniques.

### The Real Risk

I had to be honest about what could go wrong. Modern ATS systems are getting better at detecting hidden text manipulation.
Some companies specifically screen for these tactics and automatically reject resumes that use them.
Even if you make it past the ATS, there's a chance a recruiter might discover the hidden keywords when copying and pasting sections of your resume.

More importantly, this approach doesn't solve the fundamental problem--it's just a workaround for broken systems.
If everyone starts using these techniques, companies will likely develop better detection methods, and we'll be back where we started.

### Finding the Middle Ground

I kept coming back to what I saw as an important distinction: there's a difference between adding keywords for skills you actually have versus skills you don't.
If someone has `React` experience but the ATS is looking for `React.js`, that seems like a reasonable translation problem to solve.

But I also realized that good intentions don't prevent misuse. The tool could easily be used to add fake skills, regardless of my recommendations.

Despite these concerns, I still decided to release the tool, but with clear warnings about the risks and strong recommendations about responsible use.
The reality is that this isn't a perfect solution, it's a band-aid for a larger problem. But for job seekers who are genuinely qualified and just need to get past the initial keyword matching,
it might help level the playing field, at least temporarily.

## Conclusion

This has been a great learning experience, even if the outcome wasn't as straightforward as I initially hoped.
I discovered the current problem and tried hard to come up with a solution, I enjoy the process of crafting something that really smooths out my workflow, and maybe others' too.
I am glad that I can publish my first software on PyPI, even though it might not be the best tool.
For anyone considering using resume-keyword-injector: please don't use it to deceive recruiters. Only add keywords for skills you genuinely possess.
Also, understand the risk that having an invisible section might cause your resume being automatically rejected or flagged, in some company it will put you on a black list.
This tool hasn't been proven effective against all ATS systems, so use it at your own discretion and risk.
I will keep using it in some of my applications to AB test if it works or not, and will share the result in future blog posts. See you then~
